Time Spent:

I spent approximately 8 hours to complete this task.

In this task key decision I made:

In this task, I implemented a dynamic pricing rule system that allows users to add items with different pricing rules (such as bulk discounts) and calculates the total cart value based on the quantities and pricing applied. Additionally, I implemented functionality to delete items from the cart and display the total cart amount dynamically. I also ensured that users are restricted from adding duplicate items to the cart, improving data integrity.

For the UI, I used Material-UI to create a more user-friendly interface. I also added validation for number input fields to ensure that pricing and quantity inputs are accurate and properly formatted.

What I'd Do with More Time:

If I had more time, I would:

-Store item details, pricing rules, and cart data in a database and retrieve the information via API calls in the frontend.
-Implement Redux to manage the state globally throughout the application, ensuring a consistent and scalable state management approach.
-Add a fully responsive design so that the layout is perfectly visible and functional on all device sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
-Write unit tests for the pricing calculation logic and input handling using Jest to ensure that the application logic works as expected.

If we have to more scale up the functionality than :

- Build a full cart system with proper checkout functionality, including implementing a payment gateway for completing purchases.
Implement admin and customer roles, where admin users can manage pricing rules, and customers can only add items to the cart and - view the pricing rules.
Implement a notification system to alert the admin when product quantities are running low.
